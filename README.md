## Example Response

Question: How many exercises use a barbell?

Response:
The concluded result from this query returned only a single value: [(3,)].

This means that there are 3 exercises in the database that use a barbell as required equipment. Quite easy and simple, isn't it?

Here is how we would present it in a table:

| Number of Exercises Using Barbell |
| --------------------------------- |
| 3                                 |

In this table, there's just one data - the number '3' - which represents the count of barbell-using exercises in your database based on the criteria of the query.

Remember that this count is based on the information available at the time the query was performed. If more exercises using a barbell have been added since, or if some have been deleted, the count might now be different.
